# KevinLearnsBinaryTrees
* Binary tree definition
* preordertraversal definition(recursive)
	*  tacks on a list of tree node valuse acquired preorder(root, left, right) and returns the top level version of list
* postordertraversal definition(recursive)
	*  tacks on a list of tree node values acquired postorder(left, right, root) ~~~~~~~
* inordertraversal definition(recursive)
	*  tacks on a list of tree node values acquired inorder(left, root, right) ~~~~~~
* levelordertraversal(iterative?)
	*  prints array of each level reading from left to right
	*  not sure why it is useful yet
* inordertraversal definition (iterative) _(Broken)_
	*  try ing to use list of objects to keep count of which tree nodes were traversed to get here
	*  'rootlist(index).left' does not actually call the part object indexed in the list?
	*  Maybe i should try assigning a new variable to the node in the list first
## tree node named rooted is tested with itse various member functions
